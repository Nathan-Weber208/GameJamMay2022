# GameJamMay2022
Our game jam with the prompt "death is only the beginning"

Our game is goiong to be a game about a zombe who wakes up and solves his own muder. This is a top down bullet dodging game.

My main purpose for making this game is to force myself to stop delaying making a game and jst get some experiance making it. no matter how messy it turned out.

# Development Environment

Three different programs where used for this project to make the development environment.
Visual studio code for the scripting
asperite for animation and drawing
and of course unity to make the game

# Useful Websites

I learned so much from youtube videos

but most of all Miniboss tutorials in gif form are so handy
here is the link: https://blog.studiominiboss.com/pixelart
even if you dont make video games this link will be interesting for anyone

# Future Work
I might just drop this project or start it all over from scratch. I have made a lot of mistakes and ive already learned a better workflow to make a game
I should make the game pretty flushed out before i even start making the final pixel art. 
i want to pour a lot of time into understanding how to animate because it was really enjoyable.
